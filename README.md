# Election Map
Interactive map of the 2016, United States election (HTML, CSS, JS)

## What it does ##

This interactive map (incorporating a HTML5 map created by DOUGX.NET) calculates and displays election results from the 2016 presidential election in the United States. Expanded from Skillcrush's JavaScript election map project. 

As you scroll over individual states, the winning candidate for that state will be displayed along with the percentage of the vote they recieved for that state. You can also see the how much of the total vote each candidate received. 

Happy scrolling!
